Coursera Project for Getting and Cleaning Data
=======================================================================
The objective of this project is to group the information about mean, standard deviation, activity and subject into a single tidy dataset.
Detailed information can be found in the codebook.txt file.
=======================================================================
Each observation of the final dataset has 81 variables:
- 1 for activity description
- 1 for identification of the subject who carried out the experiment
- 46 for means and frequency means
- 33 for standard deviations
=======================================================================
This project includes the following files:

- README.txt
- run_analysis.R
- codebook.txt
- 'UCI HAR Dataset' directory with the files of the original project
